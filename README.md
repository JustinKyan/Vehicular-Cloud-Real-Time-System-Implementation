Everybody in our group are having problems commiting all our Java files into Justin Kyans Repository. We are using Justin's repository when submitting all codes for all Milestones. We have 5 Java Files which are: Main GUI, Admin, VCRTSRun, Client, and CarOwners. Justin Kyan, David Chang, Goden Liu, and Kevin Boukpessi worked on the Main GUI File since that required a whole lot of coding, currently we have over 200 lines of code. Tahmidul Haque worked on Client class and VCRTSRun classes and Andy Mathura worked on Car Owners class. We setted up the Admin Class to be made for preparation on other later milestones.
